# NotQuite0day

This repository documents real bugs in real software which we reported to vendors but vendors either ignored our emails and the bugs are not fixed after a long long time.

The repo is organized by the release date. In each folder you can read about the bugs, versions affected.

If necessary, we do hope that we will not be updating this repo. But if vendors choose to ignore, we will just drop them here.
